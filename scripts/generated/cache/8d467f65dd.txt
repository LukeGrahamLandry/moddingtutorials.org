    - reduced by being within 3 blocks of fire, torches, blazes or lit furnaces, raised by time spent outside

- Water (displayed above food)
    - decreases over time, faster in hot biomes

    - hold lots of water in a hydro flask (upgrade your flask to automatically drink while in your inventory)

    - some give poison or fire on hit
    - some dodge projectiles (like endermen)
- Blood moon
    - once every 8 nights hoards of monsters spawn and you can't sleep

    - the gravestone is immune to explosions and if you die in a block or the void it will move upwards to the closest air/fluid
