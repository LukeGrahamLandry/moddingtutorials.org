## Pack Changes

There are a number of user-facing changes that are part of vanilla which are not discussed below that may be relevant to modders. You can find a list of them on [Misode's version changelog](https://misode.github.io/versions/?id=1.19.4&tab=changelog).

## DamgeType and DamageSources

Damage sources have been rewritten to define common data which should be static between different sources. As such, each `DamageSource` now takes in a `DamageType` which defines this information. `DamageType`s are created in json like any other datapack registry.

The main `DamageType` record constructor takes in the following arguments:

Parameter        | Type               | Decsription
:---:            | :---:              | :---
msgId            | `String`           | A string used within a localization key (typically preceded by `death.attack.`).
scaling          | `DamageScaling`    | When the damage caused by the type should scale according to difficulty.
exhaustion       | `float`            | How much food exhaustion should occur when the damage source is applied to the player.
effects          | `DamageEffects`    | The sound to be played when the type is applied to an entity.
deathMessageType | `DeathMessageType` | How the death message should be structured for the type. Should almost always be `DEFAULT`.

A `DamageSource` is now treated as final class (it's not actually final, so it can still be extended if needed) which takes in some combination of the following parameters:

Parameter            | Type                 | Decsription
:---:                | :---:                | :---
type                 | `Holder<DamageType>` | The damage type, typically obtained from the `RegistryAccess`.
causingEntity        | `Entity`             | The entity who caused the damage directly or through the `#directEntity`.
directEntity         | `Entity`             | The entity who directly inflicted the damage.
damageSourcePosition | `Vec3`               | The position the damage source took place.

The damage sources are now constructed in `DamageSources` which can be obtained from the `Level` via `#damageSources`. Every `Entity` also has a redirect method to the level via `#damageSources`.

### DamageSourcePredicate

The `DamageSourcePredicate` for criteria triggers has been rewritten to take in a list of `TagPredicate`s for the `DamageType` applied along with the direct and causing (source) entity.

> `TagPredicate`s check if the specific object is either within or not within a tag (triggered by the `expected` boolean flag).

## GUI Changes

There have been a number of GUI changes which expands upon existing methods, restructures components, and reorganizes their locations.

### GuiComponent

All `GuiComponent` methods are now static. Additionally, new methods were added to draw information to the screen: `#renderOutline` and `#blitNineSliced`. `#setBlitOffset` and `#getBlitOffset` have been removed and are now performed using the `PoseStack` by translating the z-axis.

### ScreenRectangle

A new class called `ScreenRectangle` to specify a rectangle. This is typically used for scissors and layouts; however, it could also be used in standard rendering.

### ComponentPath

Logic relating to how components are focused and executed are now handled through `ComponentPath`s which now handle the responsibility of a for loop on a list.

### More PoseStack additions

The `PoseStack` has been added to a number of methods to properly transform the drawn information onto the screen space.

### Widget Restructing

A number of widgets have been restructured or moved into different classes to handle some common logic.

The following components have been added:
* `net.minecraft.client.gui.components.TabButton` and by extension `net.minecraft.client.gui.components.tabs.TabNavigationBar`
* `net.minecraft.client.gui.components.AbstractStringWidget` and by extension `net.minecraft.client.gui.components.MultiLineTextWidget`
* `net.minecraft.client.gui.components.ImageWidget`
* `net.minecraft.client.gui.components.TextAndImageButton`

In addition, the following components were moved, renamed, or modified:
* `net.minecraft.client.gui.components.CenteredStringWidget` -> `net.minecraft.client.gui.components.StringWidget`
* `net.minecraft.client.gui.components.AbstractWidget#renderButton` -> `#renderWidget`
* `net.minecraft.client.gui.components.AbstractWidget#getYImage` reworked into `AbstractButton#getTextureY` where it returns the texture coordinate rather than the texture index

#### Layout Components

Layout components, such as the `FrameWidget`, within `net.minecraft.client.gui.components` have been moved to `net.minecraft.client.gui.layouts`. Additionally, they have been restructure to consume widgets to properly move them to where they need to be displayed rather than having each layout be its own widget. As such, `AbstractContainerWidget` was removed.

### Font DisplayMode

`Font#drawInBatch` and any subsequent delegates (e.g. `FontRenderer#drawInBatch`) now take in a `Font$DisplayMode` instead of a boolean to determine how the font should be displayed. 

## Entity Interfaces

Entity logic has been abstracted even more into three new interfaces: `Attackable`, `Targeting`, and `TraceableEntity`. The `Attackable` interface indicates the entity can be attacked and stores the last attacker via `#getLastAttacker`. The `Targeting` interface indicates the entity can target another entity and stores the value via `#getTarget`. Finally, the `TraceableEntity` interface means that the entity's creation and initial action can be traced back to another entity, which can be obtained via `#getOwner`.

> `TraceableEntity` should not be confused with `OwnableEntity`. Traceables are typically used for projectiles or entities fired from or triggered by another entity while ownables are typically for tamed animals.

## Blocks and Sounds

Blocks have a few changes regarding their internal implementation and data structures.

The `BlockBehaviour$OffsetType` passed into `BlockBehavior$Properties#offsetType` now redirects to `BlockBehavior$OffsetFunction` which takes in a `BlockState`, `BlockGetter`, and `BlockPos` and returns the amount to offset the model by. This is currently not exposed to the end user.

A new record has been made to store common properties associated with a type, aptly named `BlockSetType`. This takes in the `SoundType` for the block in addition to sound events for flicking on or off a door, trapdoor, pressure plate, and button. Following this trend, `WoodType`s now take in the `BlockSetType` in addition to `SoundType`s for the wood and hanging sign along with `SoundEvent`s for the fence gate. `WoodType`s are also registered via the `#register` method instead of `#create`:

```java
public static final WoodType TEST_WOOD_TYPE = WoodType.register(new WoodType(new ResourceLocation(MODID, "test").toString(), BlockSetType.ACACIA));
```

> `BlockSetType`s can be created and registered using the constructor and `BlockSetType#register`, repsectively, after the `SoundEvent` registry event has fired but before the `Block` registry event.

## Creative Tabs

Creative Tabs have slightly changed as now when populating the generator, the method provides `CreativeModeTab$ItemDisplayParameters` and an `CreativeModeTab$Output`. The parameters holds the list of enabled feature, whether the player has permission, and a lookup provider on all the registries.

Custom creative tabs from the previous primer are now slightly modified to take in the two parameters: 

```java
// Registered on the MOD event bus
// Assume we have RegistryObject<Item> and RegistryObject<Block> called ITEM and BLOCK
@SubscribeEvent
public void buildContents(CreativeModeTabEvent.Register event) {
  event.registerCreativeModeTab(new ResourceLocation(MOD_ID, "example"), builder ->
    // Set name of tab to display
    builder.title(Component.translatable("item_group." + MOD_ID + ".example"))
    // Set icon of creative tab
    .icon(() -> new ItemStack(ITEM.get()))
    // Add default items to tab
    .displayItems((params, output) -> {
      output.accept(ITEM.get());
      output.accept(BLOCK.get());
    })
  );
}
```

Additionally, `net.minecraftforge.event.CreativeModeTabEvent$BuildContents` can access the parameters via `#getParameters`. The other methods now delegate to the parameters for better compatibility when updating from 1.19.3.

## Removal of `com.mojang.bridge.*`

Mojang's `javabridge` library has been removed as a dependency from Minecraft. As such, all of the redirected counterparts to the bridge (such as `com.mojang.bridge.game.PackType` and `com.mojang.bridge.game.GameVersion`) are now handled by their references or implementations (`net.minecraft.server.packs.PackType` and `net.minecraft.WorldVersion` respectively).

## Spawn Events Refactor

As of 45.0.23, spawn events have been completely refactored. For starters, `LivingSpawnEvent` has been renamed to `MobSpawnEvent`. Even further `CheckSpawn` and `SpecialSpawn` hae been merged into a single event: `FinalizeSpawn`. `FinalizeSpawn` can be canceled to prevent `Mob#finalizeSpawn` from being called while the entity itself can be prevent using` FinalizeSpawn#setSpawnCancelled`.

If you want to learn more about this event and the technical changes, see the [blog post](https://blog.minecraftforge.net/breaking/spawnevents/).

## Minor Additions, Changes, and Removals

The following is a list of useful or interesting additions, changes, and removals that do not deserve their own section in the primer.

### New Registries

In addition to `DamageType`s, a static registry for decorated pot patterns and datapack registries for trim materials, trim patterns, and `MultiNoiseBiomeSourceParameterList` have been added.

Additionally, Forge has added a new static registry for `ItemDisplayContext`s aptly named `forge:display_contexts` for registering perspectives an item may be rendered within, replacing custom `TransformType`s. There can only be at most 256 display contexts.

### New Codecs

A number of new codecs have been added or changed:
  * `com.mojang.math.Transformation#CODEC`
  * `net.minecraft.util.ExtraCodecs#QUATERNIONF_COMPONENTS`
  * `net.minecraft.util.ExtraCodecs#AXISANGLE4F`
  * `net.minecraft.util.ExtraCodecs#MATRIX4F`

### Sprite Registration Refactoring

First, `net.minecraft.client.particle.ParticleProvider$Sprite` is added, which is a functional interface used to create a `TextureSheetParticle` with only one texture. This is used as a wrapper around a `ParticleEngine$SpriteParticleRegistration` when the particle does not need access to the `SpriteSet`.

Additionally, as of 45.0.25, all `net.minecraftforge.client.event.RegisterParticleProvidersEvent#register` methods have been deprecated for removal, opting to switch to method names which better specify their usecase:

* `#register(ParticleType, ParticleProvider)` -> `#registerSpecial`
* `#register(ParticleType, ParticleProvider$Sprite)` -> `#registerSprite`
* `#register(ParticleType, ParticleEngine$SpriteParticleRegistration)` -> `#registerSpriteSet`

### Additions

* `net.minecraft.client.model.geom.builders.CubeListBuilder#addBox` can now take in a set of directions which indicates the visible faces to render of a given box. This is baked into the `net.minecraft.client.model.geom.ModelPart$Cube` when adding the polygons.
* `net.minecraft.client.model.AgeableHierarchicalModel` - A parallel to `net.minecraft.client.modelAgeableListModel`s for `HierarchialModel`s.
* `net.minecraft.client.model.HumanoidArmorModel` - An extension of `net.minecraft.client.model.HumanoidModel` for armor models.
* `com.mojang.blaze3d.vertex.PoseStack#rotateAround` - Rotates a quaternion around a point.

* `net.minecraft.util.ParticleUtils#spawnParticleBelow` - Spawns a particle half a block below the specified position
* `net.minecraft.world.inventory.Slot#setByPlayer` - A method indicating that a player changed the slot in some capacity.
* `net.minecraft.world.effect.MobEffectInstance#endsWithin` - Returns whether the mob effect will expire in x ticks.
* `net.minecraft.world.entity.Entity#getControlledVehicle` - Returns the vehicle if it is being controlled by this entity.
* `net.minecraft.world.phys.AABB#distanceToSqr` - Gets the squared distance to the provided vector.
* `net.minecraft.world.phys.Vec3#atLowerCornerWithOffset` - Offsets the vector by the specified x, y, z coordinates.
* `net.minecraft.world.phys.Vec3#atCenterOf` - Offsets the vector by 0.5 in all directions.
* `net.minecraft.data.advancements.AdvancementSubProvider#createPlaceholder` - Creates a dummy advancement to use as a parent for another advancement.
* `net.minecraft.network.FriendlyByteBuf#readJsonWithCodec` and #writeJsonWithCodec` - Writes a encoded object to json into a buffer.
    * `Tag` implementations `#readWithCodec` and `#writeWithCodec` are currently deprecated.
* `net.minecraft.client.renderer.texture.Dumpable` - Dumps the contents of the object to a file (`DynamicTexture`, `TextureAtlas`).
* `net.minecraft.world.entity.LivingEntity#remove` - Removes the entity from the level for the specified reason.
* `net.minecraft.world.entity.ai.Brain#clearMemories` - Clears all the memory values of an entity's brain.
* `com.mojang.math.MatrixUtil` contains some additional [jacobi matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobian_matrix_and_determinant) methods.
* `net.minecraft.world.level.GrassColor#getDefaultColor` - Gets the default color of grass.
* `net.minecraft.network.syncher.SynchedEntityData#set(EntityDataAccessor, T, boolean)` - Boolean parameter added to force a sync of the entity data.
* `net.minecraftforge.fml.CrashReportCallables` can now be supplied a callable which will append to the system report when the boolean supplier returns `true`.

### Changes

* `net.minecraft.world.level.biome.Biome#isHumid` -> `#hasPrecipitation`
* `net.minecraft.world.level.biome.Biome#getPrecipitation()` -> `#getPrecipitationAt(BlockPos)`
* `net.minecraft.world.entity.LivingEntity#animationSpeedOld`, `#animationSpeed`, and `#animationPosition` has been bundled into one public object on the entity known as `WalkAnimationState`.
* `net.minecraft.server.packs.repository.PackRepository#addPack` and `#removePack` now return a boolean on whether the action was successful.
* `net.minecraft.client.gui.screens.worldselection.WorldGenSettingsComponent` -> `WorldCreationUiState`

* `net.minecraft.world.entity.PlayerRideableJumping#canJump(Player)` -> `#canJump()`
* `net.minecraft.data.tags.TagsProvider` now can take in a `CompletableFuture<TagsProvider.TagLookup<T>>` if tags need to be accessed from other `TagProvider`s. A lookup can be obtained via `TagsProvider#contentsGetter`.
* `net.minecraft.world.item.ArmorItem` now take in a delegate to the `EquipmentSlot` called `ArmorItem$Type` within their constructors and associated references.
* `net.minecraft.core.BlockPos` constructors that take in doubles should migrate to using `BlockPos#containing`.
* `net.minecraft.world.level.biome.MobSpawnSettings$SpawnerData#minCount` and `#maxCount` must be positive values.

### Removals

* `net.minecraft.world.level.biome.Biome#hasDownfall` as it was only used by the `#isHumid` check, now `#hasPrecipitation`.
* `com.mojang.blaze3d.systems.RenderSystem#enableTexture` and `#disableTexture` as they have not been doing anything other than adding extra cycles to the logic execution.
